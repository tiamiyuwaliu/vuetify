## What is Vuetify?

Since its initial release in 2014, [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) has grown to be among the most popular JavaScript frameworks in the world. One of the reasons for this popularity is the wide use of [components](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/component-basics.html) which enable developers to create small modules to be used and re-used throughout an application. Vuetify is a collection of Vue components paired with powerful features such [dynamic themes](/features/theme/), [global defaults](/features/global-configuration/), [application layouts](/features/application-layout/), and more. Its goal is to provide developers with all of the necessary tools to build rich and engaging user experiences.

## Why Vuetify? { id="why-vuetify" }

Vuetify is a powerful UI Component Framework built from the ground up to make front-end development as simple as possible.

Vuetify is built from the ground up to be easy to learn and rewarding to master. Maintain a consistent style throughout your application and be as verbose or concise as you want using **props**, **slots**, or individual **components**. Build complex.

### Flexible components

Every component in Vuetify is handcrafted under the guise of Google's [Material Design specification](https://material.io/) and comes with hundreds of customization options to can fit any style or design; even if it's not Material. Write Vue templates that are as concise or verbose as you want using exlusively or a combination of:

* Properties
* Slots
* Components

Write the bare minimum by using API properties and no additional elements:

<example file="why-vuetify/card-props" open preview />

Or use slots to gain control over the content areas:

<example file="why-vuetify/card-slots" open preview />

Or write your own markup using individual components:

<example file="why-vuetify/card-components" open preview />

This is the power of Vuetify; it just works. There is no one right way, just yours.
